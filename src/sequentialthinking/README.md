# Enhanced Sequential Thinking MCP Server

An advanced MCP server implementation that provides AI-powered tools for intelligent, adaptive problem-solving through structured thinking processes.

## ðŸš€ Enhanced Features

### ðŸ§  Intelligent Thinking Analysis
- **Pattern Recognition**: Automatically identifies thinking patterns (analytical, creative, systematic, exploratory, iterative)
- **Quality Assessment**: Evaluates thoughts on coherence, depth, breadth, originality, and relevance
- **Smart Suggestions**: Provides personalized recommendations based on current thinking patterns
- **Pitfall Detection**: Warns about common thinking traps and suggests alternatives

### ðŸ’¾ Advanced Memory Management
- **Automatic Compression**: Intelligently compresses old thoughts to maintain performance
- **Quality-based Retention**: Keeps high-quality thoughts while cleaning up low-value content
- **Memory Statistics**: Real-time monitoring of memory usage and compression ratios
- **Smart Cleanup**: Configurable thresholds for optimal memory management

### âš¡ Asynchronous Processing
- **Parallel Evaluation**: Quality assessment runs in background without blocking
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of multiple thoughts simultaneously
- **Task Queue Management**: Prioritized processing with retry mechanisms
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track processing times and queue statistics

### ðŸ“ˆ Learning and Improvement
- **Pattern Learning**: Learns from successful thinking strategies over time
- **Success Rate Analysis**: Tracks which patterns lead to better outcomes
- **Personalized Insights**: Generates improvement suggestions based on history
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors thinking quality trends and improvements

## Tool

### sequential_thinking

Facilitates a detailed, step-by-step thinking process for problem-solving and analysis.

**Inputs:**
- `thought` (string): The current thinking step
- `nextThoughtNeeded` (boolean): Whether another thought step is needed
- `thoughtNumber` (integer): Current thought number
- `totalThoughts` (integer): Estimated total thoughts needed
- `isRevision` (boolean, optional): Whether this revises previous thinking
- `revisesThought` (integer, optional): Which thought is being reconsidered
- `branchFromThought` (integer, optional): Branching point thought number
- `branchId` (string, optional): Branch identifier
- `needsMoreThoughts` (boolean, optional): If more thoughts are needed

## Usage

The Sequential Thinking tool is designed for:
- Breaking down complex problems into steps
- Planning and design with room for revision
- Analysis that might need course correction
- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially
- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps
- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out

## Configuration

### Usage with Claude Desktop

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

#### npx

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### docker

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequentialthinking": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "mcp/sequentialthinking"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

To disable logging of thought information set env var: `DISABLE_THOUGHT_LOGGING` to `true`.

For manual installation, add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and typing `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)`.

Optionally, you can add it to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others.

> Note that the `mcp` key is not needed in the `.vscode/mcp.json` file.

For NPX installation:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "sequential-thinking": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": [
          "-y",
          "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For Docker installation:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "sequential-thinking": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "--rm",
          "-i",
          "mcp/sequentialthinking"
        ]
      }
    }
